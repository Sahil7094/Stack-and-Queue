// Design an algorithm that collects daily price quotes for some stock and returns the span of that stock's price for the current day.
// The span of the stock's price in one day is the maximum number of consecutive days (starting from that day and going backward)
// for which the stock price was less than or equal to the price of that day.
// For example, if the prices of the stock in the last four days is [7,2,1,2] and the price of the stock today is 2, 
// then the span of today is 4 because starting from today, the price of the stock was less than or equal 2 for 4 consecutive days.
// Also, if the prices of the stock in the last four days is [7,34,1,2] and the price of the stock today is 8, then the span of today is 3 
// because starting from today, the price of the stock was less than or equal 8 for 3 consecutive days.
// Implement the StockSpanner class:
// StockSpanner() Initializes the object of the class.
// int next(int price) Returns the span of the stock's price given that today's price is price.
// Example 1:
// Input
// ["StockSpanner", "next", "next", "next", "next", "next", "next", "next"]
// [[], [100], [80], [60], [70], [60], [75], [85]]
// Output
// [null, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 6]
// Code :-
class StockSpanner {
public:

    stack<pair<int, int>>st;
    StockSpanner() {
        
    }
    
    int next(int price) {
        int span=1;
        while(!st.empty() && st.top().first<=price){
            span = span + st.top().second;
            st.pop();
        }
        st.push({price,span});
        return span;
